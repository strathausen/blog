## Profile

With 16 years of professional experience as a full-stack developer, I've had the privilege of working on a diverse array of projects for clients across industries, including fashion, automotive, and aeronautics.

After university, I joined Fit Analytics as the technical co-founder. It went on to become a market leader in online size recommendations. Co-founding Codepan followed, where I collaborated with major clients like Daimler, Wix, and Webasto.

I'm currently working at Your Juno, where I am part of a small team and have bootstrapped an app from the ground up. Sadly, Juno is undergoing a transformation and I will become available shortly.

Throughout my career, I've excelled in fast-paced, evolving environments by proactively identifying potential time sinks and opting for pragmatic solutions that yield both immediate results and long-term maintainability.

My tools of choice are currently **typescript**, **nodejs**, **rust**, **nextjs**, **react** and **postgres** - but I'm constantly learning more.
