# now

## work

i'm currently working on my own idea: <a href="https://www.thefoodie.space">thefoodie.space</a>.
it's a platform for sharing food recipes.technologies i'm using are typescript, prisma, postgres, trpc and nextjs/react.
using llms for content moderation and importing recipes.

i'm still looking for content creators willing to work with me.

aside from that, i'm working with <a href="https://www.yourjuno.co">your juno</a> on smaller things.
we're using react-native, graphql, koa, postgres, prisma and typescript.

## learning

i am getting into rust, which i'm enjoying a lot so far.
also it's my first time using nextjs with server components.
