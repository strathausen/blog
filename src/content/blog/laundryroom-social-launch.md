## what is laundryroom.social?

laundryroom is a place to organize meetups for free.

## why i built it

the idea for **[laundryroom.social](https://www.laundryroom.social)** came from
my frustration meetup.com.
their pricing is completely detached from reality.
they're holding meetup groups **hostage** - if you don't pay up, the group will
go to the next person who's willing to pay their fantasy prices.

the name "laundry room" is inspired by my first years in berlin, living in a
student hostel. the laundry room was a place where you would meet random people.

## what’s next

i've put it out there to see if there's a need for a platform like that.
understandably, people are hesitant to go to another platform - meetup.com destroyed
the trust for the rest of us.  some meetups now prefer distributed solutions,
or messenger apps.

anyway, I'm thinking of adding new features every now and then. here are some ideas i’m exploring: 

- **distributed setup**: maybe using some protocol, allow people to run their own servers
- **geo search**: making it easier for people to find events nearby.
- **visibility and privacy**: private groups, nsfw mode, limited slots for events
- **integrations**: allow integration with other platforms and tools for more flexibility.

i've made the whole thing open source so you can run your own pod or something: [github.com/strathausen](https://github.com/strathausen/laundryroom.social)

i’d love your feedback—what features would you like to see? what’s missing in the current meetup landscape?
