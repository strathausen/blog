## what is laundryroom.social?

laundryroom is a place to organize meetups.

## why i built it

the idea for **[laundryroom.social](https://www.laundryroom.social)** came from
frustration with platforms like meetup.com. their steep price hikes and
practices of holding meetups, images, and messages **hostage**—deleting them
within a month if you don’t pay—felt wrong. i wanted to build something better,
a platform that respects its users and allows them to create and connect **for
free**.

the name "laundry room" is inspired by my first years in berlin, living in a
student hostel. the laundry room was this unique, shared space where i’d
randomly meet people i hadn’t met yet. it was a place where connections
happened naturally. i wanted to capture that spirit and make it digital—a
simple, open space for everyone to build their own communities.

## what makes laundryroom.social different?

- **free for everyone**: no fees, no subscriptions. just a platform for hosting and joining meetups.
- **pledgeboard**: if you need to distribute tasks for each meetup, the pleadgeboard can help you there. some examples might be: who brings snacks? who gives a talk? who cleans up the dishes?

## what’s next

we're just getting started! here are some features and ideas i’m exploring: 

- **geo search**: making it easier for people to find events nearby.
- **visibility and privacy**: private groups, nsfw mode, limited space for meetups
- **opening up**: allow integration with other platforms and tools for more flexibility. i'm also thinking to make the whole thing open source so you can run your own pod or something.

i’d love your feedback—what features would you like to see? what’s missing in the current meetup landscape?
