after weeks of choosing [the right stack](https://create.t3.gg/), i finally started working on
[tomatovillage.com](https://www.tomatovillage.com), a place where people can share
recipes with each other. right now, it's just a landing page with dummy content
that lets you create an account.

## planned features

- remix recipes from other users
- set up your own food blog
- import recipes from other places
- follow food bloggers you like

## the tech stack

i've opted for prisma, postgres and nextjs. so far i'm quite happy with it. i
wanted to use vue at first, because i really wanted to like it, but damn i hate
how productive i am with react. so react it is. again.

for styling, i've let myself be brainwashed into giving tailwind a try. i really
wanted to hate tailwind, but i have to admit, i fell in love with it really
fast. it's so easy to bring my vision to life and make it look good.

## roadmap

here are some things i have planned so far:

1. [x] users can sign in
1. [ ] users can create recipes
1. [ ] users can like, share, remix... and se their feed
1. [ ] ...and more
1. [ ] a mobile app for sure!

stay tuned.
