## what is pleeboo?

[pleeboo](https://www.pleeboo.com) is a free tool for organizing community events and coordinating volunteers. it helps you create pledge boards where people can sign up to bring things or help out.

## why i built it

organizing events is a pain. who's bringing what? did someone already sign up for drinks? is the signup sheet still up to date?

i wanted something simple that just works - no sign-ups, no credit cards, no premium tiers. just create a board, share the link, and let people pledge what they'll bring.

## how it works

1. create a pledge board in seconds
2. share the link with your community
3. people pledge what they'll bring or do
4. track progress in real-time

the platform even gives you smart suggestions based on your event type, so you don't have to think of everything yourself.

## use cases

- community gatherings (block parties, fundraisers, festivals)
- school events (bake sales, field trips, pta activities)
- team building (office parties, retreats)
- family celebrations (reunions, holidays, birthdays)

## what's next

i'm exploring ways to make event coordination even easier. some ideas:

- **recurring events**: for regular meetups and gatherings
- **integrations**: calendar sync, messaging apps
- **templates**: pre-made boards for common event types
