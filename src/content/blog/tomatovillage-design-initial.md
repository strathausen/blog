covid struck once again and took me out for a few weeks. now i'm back with a few changes:

- the recipe editor works!
- there's a new design, inspired by the [arc browser](https://arc.net/) -
  a light texture and a gradient, with glass-like accents, shadows and rounded edges.

## the design challenge

i wanted a design that is easy on the eyes but also doesn't look too boring. recipe apps have a tricky balance to strike - the food should be the star, but the interface still needs personality.

most recipe sites fall into two camps: either they're cluttered with ads and popups, or they're so minimal they feel lifeless. i wanted something in between.

## inspiration from arc browser

the arc browser has this beautiful approach to ui design - subtle gradients, frosted glass effects, and generous whitespace. it feels modern without being cold.

i borrowed a few ideas:

- **light texture**: a subtle noise pattern that adds warmth
- **gradient backgrounds**: soft color transitions instead of flat colors
- **glass-like cards**: slightly transparent elements with blur effects
- **rounded edges**: everything feels soft and approachable

## before and after

check out the **before**:

and the **after**:

## what's next

i'm not sure about the buttons yet - they might need more contrast. but overall i'm happy with where it's going. the next step is to apply this design language consistently across all pages.
