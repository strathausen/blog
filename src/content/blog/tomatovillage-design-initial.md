covid struck once again and took me out for a few weeks. now I'm back with a few changes:

- the recipe editor works!
- there's a new design, inspired by the [arc browser](https://arc.net/) -
  a light texture and a gradient, with glass-like accents, shadows and rounded edges.

I wanted a design that is easy on the eyes but also doesn't look too boring.

check out the **before**:

and the **after**:

I'm not sure about the buttons yet, but overall I'm happy with where it's going.
