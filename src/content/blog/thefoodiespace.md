i haven't posted an update on tomatovillage for a while - but a lot has happened.

## a new name

i found a new name for the food blogging platform.
what used to be tomatovillage is now [thefoodie.space](https://www.thefoodie.space).
the new name is self explanatory and has potential to play around with space in branding and marketing.

## a logo

after messing with a few logo ideas on chatgpt using food, cats, planets and other space related
keywords, i settled for this cat in a planet bowl:

## new features

here's what's new:

- a recipe editor
- social interactions on recipes: like, bookmark, comment
- a notifications feed (for likes and comments)
- content gets moderated via openai (comments and recipes)
- automatic alt-tags on recipe images
- you can import a recipe text and get it parsed by ai
- it's using [algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) for search

## what's next

i want to get the paperwork for google and facebook logins done soon.
there are still a lot of small bugs and quirks to be sorted out,
especially in the search.

next i would like to work on seo and start building a mobile app.
