## the problem with working from home

when you work from home as a freelancer, your work is always up for debate. office workers leave, work, return—done. but freelancers carry invisible guilt. you can always do more tomorrow, finish later, squeeze in one more task. this flexibility, meant to be a benefit, becomes a source of anxiety.

and then there's the relationship angle: your partner can't see your work reality. they leave for work at 9, come home at 6, and their day has clear boundaries. yours doesn't. they might assume you're working when you're actually struggling to hit 4 productive hours because the kids needed attention, the plumber came, and you had a doctor's appointment.

existing time trackers don't help. toggl and harvest are built for client billing—too complex for personal accountability. surveillance apps have the wrong vibe entirely. habit trackers measure the wrong thing. nothing combines simple hour tracking with the ability to share your progress with someone who cares.

## what is wobbly

[wobbly](https://www.wobblytime.com) is radically simple:

- **visual timetable** — toggle hours on a weekly grid, like a paper planner
- **daily targets** — set your minimum (e.g., 6 hours) and ideal (e.g., 8 hours) with color-coded feedback
- **weekly context** — if you're behind on monday, tuesday's target adjusts to show an achievable recovery path
- **partner sharing** — generate a link your partner can check whenever they're curious about your day

that last feature is the key differentiator. no other time tracker has it. it's not surveillance—it's mutual understanding. your partner sees the same view you do: your hours, your targets, your trajectory for the week.

## why it matters

the goal isn't productivity optimization. it's peace of mind.

when you hit your target, you can close your laptop and be fully present with your family—no guilt. when you're behind, you know exactly where you stand and what it takes to catch up. and your partner understands your work constraints without you having to explain every evening.

wobbly makes the invisible visible.

## the tech

built with next.js, trpc, drizzle orm, and better auth. dark mode only, because freelancers work late.
