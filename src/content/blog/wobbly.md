juggling working from home with kids is not easy. so i've built a little tool to better plan my work week and more easily communicate it to my partner.
she leaves for work at a certain time in the morning and comes back when work is done. her work day has clear boundaries, mostly.

my work day on the other hand is always up for negotiation. sure i can finish that one thing tomorrow instead of today.
i can put in another hour in the evening, or on the weekend...doctor or school appointments clutter almost every day and suddenly i'm 10 hours short by the end of the week.

## what i built

[wobbly](https://www.wobblytime.com):

- **weekly grid** — toggle hours on/off like a paper planner
- **daily and weekly targets** — set your minimum and ideal hours, get color-coded feedback
- **partner sharing** — generate a link so your partner can see your progress

## why it matters

when i hit my target, i close my laptop guilt-free. when i'm behind, i know exactly what it takes to catch up. and my partner understands my constraints.

this is not about productivity optimization, but about peace of mind - for both of us.
