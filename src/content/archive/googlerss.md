## Google ditching RSS? Thanks for reminding me!

Thanks to Google recently ditching RSS,
I finally installed a decent
<a href="http://lzone.de/liferea/">RSS reader</a>
on my system and stopped depending on yet another web service.

The incident also reminded me
to implement RSS for my own blog,
which basically meant
<a href="https://github.com/strathausen/blog/blob/master/theme/rss.mustache">writing another template</a>.
