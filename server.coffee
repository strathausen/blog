Some generic file server boilerplate with simple routing and logging.

Because I found this easier to write than to get .htaccess do what I wanted.

Options:
  rewrites  - hash of string to string, e.g. { '/': '/index.html' }
  ignore    - regex, generic redirect, e.g. /^\/en/ will redirect
              /en/profile to /profile
  redirects - hash map with aliases of URLS; like rewrites, but redirecting;
              like ignore, but a hashmap with strings
  config    - { static, public } folders that serve static content whereas
              both are identical (static content vs. generated static content)
