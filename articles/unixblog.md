## Unix-Style Blogging

Whenever releasing a library or a module,
I try shipping it with a command line tool that does the same thing!
I noticed that many people in the node.js community already do that,
but I wish more people would do so too.

Instead of writing just another
library for some platform, you create a univeral tool.
Suddenly, one can combine that library with many other tools
implemented in different languages or runtimes.

That's what I did while writing
 <a href="/mumpitz">static site generator that I wrote</a> some time ago.


### Meet the two tools

So I wanted something that reads some files in a format
I could edit with my
editor of choice into HTML. Big deal. Many static site generators
do that.

While refactoring re-usable chunks of my code
into modules, I figured that the minimum toolset to power a basic blog
generator where only two:

- One tool for converting a source data format into an intermediate format,
 i.E. Yaml annotated markdown files into JSON,
 let's call it `yamlmd2json`.
 Any other tool that understands JSON can hook in here.

- Another one to render JSON with
<a href="http://handlebarsjs.com">Handlebars templates</a> (like
<a href="http://mustache.github.io/">Mustache</a>)
 to HTML files, lets call it `json2html`.

The modules that expose these tools are available via
 <a href="http://npmjs.org">npm</a> and I called them
`yamlmd` and `schnauzer` (horrible name, I know).

### Setup

You can install these awesome programs globally on your system:

``` bash
sudo npm i yamlmd -g
sudo npm i schnauzer -g
```

Or install them locally via ```npm i -S```
and include ```./node_modules/.bin/``` in your `PATH`.

You will have two executables at your disposal.

``` bash
# convert yaml-markdown to json
yamlmd2json < article.md > article.json
# render json with handlebars / mustache
json2html --body template.hbs \
  < article.json > article.html
```

### Workflow

So now you can use my node.js-lib even wihout caring about node.js or
JavaScript.

``` bash
# create the template
echo '<h1>{{title}}</h1>
<p>{{{html}}}</p>' > template.hbs

# render the template with content
echo 'title: "The Title"

And here is the content...
' | yamlmd2json | json2html --body template.hbs

# This is what you will get:
#   <h1>The Title</h1>
#   <p>And here is the content...</p>
```

It took me, the author, almost no effort to turn the modules into

### Go nuts!

You can use any other text processing tools to work,
like the ones listed on that
<a href="http://http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3858671/unix-command-line-json-parser">Stackoverflow-question</a>
or that <a href="http://http://trentm.com/json/">awesome json query
and manipulation tool</a>
(which, by coincidence, happens to be implemented in node.js too),
 also pandoc and asciidoc.

Now have bash glue them together.

``` bash
# some sane default values for your blog
defaults='{ "author": "Me <supertrooper2013@aol.com>" }'

# render all the articles to html
for article in articles/*.md
do
  # convert article file into json data
  data=`yamlmd2json $article`

  # merge defaults with article data
  props=`$defaults$data | json --merge`;

  # extract properties from original article
  title=`echo $props | json title`
  template=`echo $props | json template`

  # save the article with the title as file name
  echo $props | json2html --body $template > public/${title}.html
done
```

I didn't actually test this code, but it should just workâ„¢.

### How to do it in node.js

Turning a npm module into a command line tool is easy.
Say, you've got that awesome tool that converts json to msword documents.

1. add this to your `package.json`

``` js
{ "bin": { "json2msword": "./bin/json2msword.js" } },
```

2. create the actual command line tool using your lib

``` js
/* ./bin/js2msword.js */
var json2msword = require('../')
  , mapStream = require('map-stream');
process.stdin.pipe(mapStream(
  function(text, cb) {
    var result = json2msword(JSON.parse(text.toString()));
    cb(null, result);
  }
));
```
