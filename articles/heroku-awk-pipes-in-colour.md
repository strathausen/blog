## Preserve colours in heroku logs when piping

Just a little trick of the day to make use of your fancy colour monitor when piping
heroku logs around.

```/usr/local/heroku/lib/heroku/helpers/log_displayer.rb```
around line 20, remove the condition that says 

``` ruby
if STDOUT.isatty && ENV.has_key?("TERM")
  display(colorize(chunk))
else
  display(chunk)
end
```

to something like this

``` ruby
display(colorize(chunk))
```

Make sure you don't use the heroku logs anywhere else,
where this modification may break anything.

You may also want to modify the other occurence of the same
condition a few lines further down to 

``` bash
heroku logs --app nodecload -t|sed 's/2[^ ]* //'
```

Enjoy a happier life.
