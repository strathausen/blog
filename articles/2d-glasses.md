## The 2D revolution: Home made 2D glasses

When going out with friends to see a film,
we're always arguing about whether we should see it
in 3D or in 2D.

There is a solution: Home made 2D glasses!
One can now go to a film in 3D, enjoying the superiour 3D price,
but watch it in 2D!

### Whoa, how??

Two easy steps:

1. take two pairs of 2d glasses (those made of paper) and
   cut one left glass from one pair and one right glass the other pair
2. exchange them so that one pair of glasses has two left glasses and
   the other one has two right glasses

The result: Two pairs of 2d glasses!
