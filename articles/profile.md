Hi, I'm Philipp, a Berlin based freelancing full-stack engineer.

I work with
<a href="http://m-click.aero/">m-click.aero</a>
on awesome tools that make aeronautics even more amazing!

During the past four years,
I've build all the back-end and infrastructure of
<a href="http://www.upcload.com">UPcload</a> a.k.a.
<a href="http://www.fitanalytics.com">Fit Analytics</a>
as the CTO and lead developer
from the ground up.

Fit Analytics is the world's leading size advisor and
solves the fitting problem of online apparel shopping.
UPcload features an innovative technology
that measures your body dimensions with a webcam
whereas Fit Analytics provides advanced fit prediction for clothes,
and so much more than that.
