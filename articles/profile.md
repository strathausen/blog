## About me

<img src="/strathausen.jpeg" />

Hi, I'm Philipp, CTO, lead developer and co-owner of
<a href="http://www.upcload.com">UPcload</a>, a Berlin based
startup that solves the fitting problem of online apparel shopping.
We've developed a technology that measures your body dimensions with a webcam
to provide a fit prediction for clothes.

### Computing

Check my <a href="http://github.com/strathausen/dotfiles">dotfiles at github</a> to get an
impresson of how I get stuff done.

Currently I'm mostly doing JavaScript development on both, the back-end and the
front-end.  Deep in my heart, I'm a haskell guy.
